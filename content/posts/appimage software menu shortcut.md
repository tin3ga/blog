# Introduction 

I am going demonstrate how you can add an appimage application shortcut to linux desktop system's application menu and also how to customize its icon.But first lets get to understand what an appimage software is.

# What is an appimage application

For starters,there are many ways an application can be installed in a linux system i.e deb packages,snaps,flatpaks and appimages.Our focus today is appimages.
An Appimage application is a single portable and executable software that can be run on linux without installation.

## Benefits of using appimages

* Compatibility with most linux distributions.
* Simple to run i.e download,make it executable and run.since it is not installed no system libraries are altered.
* Download and use trusted software directly from the original author(s).
* Uninstalling is as simple as just deleting the file. 

# Running an app image

Lets download the fluent reader software(it is a modern rss reader) as an example.

Once download is completed,navigate to the downloads folder and right-click on the downloaded appimage file,click on Properties thereafter,Click on the permissions tab and check the execute option.
