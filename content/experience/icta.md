## Description

**Supervisor:** **Ernest Kangogo** (County ICT Officer)

I worked as an intern at [**ICT Authority**](https://www.icta.go.ke/) (Machakos), the corporation is tasked with rationalizing and streamlining the management of all Government of Kenya ICT functions, whose mandate entails enforcing ICT standards in Government and enhancing the supervision of its electronic communication.

Here, I acquired useful knowledge and practical experience in network access management and monitoring, troubleshooting computer networks and systems, and setting up and maintaining computer hardware and software.

I gained a deeper understanding of network planning, configuration, and troubleshooting in a medium-sized business environment thanks to this opportunity. My ability to communicate, work in a team, and solve problems also improved.
